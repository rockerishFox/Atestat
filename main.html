            The band first gained exposure with the release of single "It's Time", followed by their award-winning debut studio album Night Visions (2012), which resulted in the chart topping singles "Radioactive" and "Demons". Billboard placed them at the top of their "Year In Rock" rankings for 2013 and 2017 and named them their "Breakthrough Band of 2013", and "Biggest Band of 2017". Rolling Stone named their single "Radioactive", which holds the record for most weeks on the Hot 100, from Night Visions the "biggest rock hit of the year", and MTV called them "the year's biggest breakout band". The band's second studio album Smoke + Mirrors (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK.

        "  Imagine Dragons' career trajectory to date has been nigh on flawless. Ten years and three ruthlessly commercial albums down the line, the Las Vegas rock band have notched up close to 50m record sales, and ascended to the rarefied level where they can fill two nights at the 20,000-capacity 02 arena.
        <p>
        This steep rise is all the more remarkable as they are distinctly short on  originality. While intermittently diverting, their sleek arena rock is   essentially an opportunistic synthesis of current musical tropes and existing mega-bands, a classic example of success being one-tenth inspiration, nine-tenths perspiration.
        <p> 
        Their current world tour takes its theme from their last album, 2017's Evolve, and after an ambitious opening film that attempts to distil the history of man into two minutes, frontman Dan Reynolds hits the ground running. A muscular, fresh-faced dude whose aerobic dancing suggests a boyband escapee, he kneels on a catwalk to bemoan the state of modern America and call for a global surge of peace and love: "People call it corny and cliched: I don't give a damn."  " </p>

                        There are definitely clever electronic effects on the multilayered Believer and a touch of Queen's theatrical bombast and sonic adventurousness on Yesterday, but the earnest tone of self-importance, and the comic effects - such as the squeaky robotic voices on Thunder."<br>
